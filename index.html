            Life can get complicated really quickly, but it doesn't have to be!
            There are many ways to simplify your life, a few of which we've
            explored in the past. This week we're taking a bit of a approach
            though, in how you can find simplicity in the life you already
            living.

          <h3>Simplicity and work</h3>

            Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it
            ruins their relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By
            keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will help balance
            everything out.

            People either don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't
            have the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw
            the eye where you want it to and make things pop like never before.
